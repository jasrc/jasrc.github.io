<p>I've been working with <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/">Java</a> since 1997.
Other languages I'm using are C / C++, SQL, HTML / XML / YAML / MD, CSS, JavaScript and others.
Starting with Borland IDEs for several languages, later Visual Age and Rational Application Developer,
I have been using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> for a very long time and sometimes <a href="https://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>.</br>
Nowadays I work with <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> based IDEs.
For example for <a href="https://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a> I also use <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>.</p>

<p>This site and associated repositories are still under construction.</br>
