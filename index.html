<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I've been working with <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a> since 1997.
Other languages I'm using are C/C++, SQL, MarkUps (HTML,XML,YAML,...), CSS, JavaScript and others.
Starting with Borland IDEs for several languages,
later IBM IDEs Visual Age, Websphere Studio Application Developer and Rational Application Developer,
I have been using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> and sometimes <a href="https://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a> for a very long time.<br/>
Nowadays I work with <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> based IDEs.
For example for <a href="https://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a> I also use <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a>.</p>
