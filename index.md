I've been working with [Java][] since 1997.  
Other languages I'm using are:
* C / C++
* SQL
* HTML / XML / YAML / MD, CSS, JavaScript
* and others  

Starting with IDEs for several languages from Borland Turbo and Builder, later IBM IDEs Visual Age, Websphere Studio Application Developer and Rational Application Developer,
I have been using [Eclipse][] and sometimes [Netbeans][] for a very long time.
Nowadays I work with [Eclipse][] and [Eclipse][] based IDEs.
For example for PlatformIO I also use [Eclipse][].

[Eclipse][] and [Netbeans][] are available for several languages including:
* Java
* C / C++
* HTML
* JavaScript
